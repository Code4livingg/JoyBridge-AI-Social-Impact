# 🌸 JoyBridge – Final Professional Project Blueprint

## Project Identity
**Name:** JoyBridge  
**Domain:** AI-powered Social Impact Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

JoyBridge is an AI-powered, safety-first social impact platform that enables structured and supervised festival participation for children in institutional care. It connects verified families, hostels, NGOs, and corporate sponsors to create emotionally meaningful celebrations with full legal compliance, safety monitoring, and impact tracking.
